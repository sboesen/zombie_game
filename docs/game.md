# Zombie Apocalypse: Expanded Game Content

## Primary UI and Basic Gameplay Interaction

The game's primary interface is text-based, presented in a clean, easy-to-read format in the player's web browser. The main screen is divided into several sections:

1. Location Description: At the top of the screen, a vivid text description of the current location is displayed, updating as the player moves or interacts with the environment.

2. Character Status: On the left side, the player's vital statistics are shown, including health, hunger, thirst, and fatigue levels, as well as any active status effects (e.g., injured, infected).

3. Inventory: Below the character status, a scrollable list of the player's carried items is displayed, showing item names and quantities.

4. Action Menu: On the right side, a list of available actions is presented. These change based on the current location and situation, and may include options like "Move", "Search", "Use Item", "Craft", or "Rest".

5. Message Log: At the bottom of the screen, a scrollable log shows recent events, combat results, and discoveries.

6. Command Input: A text input field allows players to type commands for more complex actions not covered by the action menu.

Basic gameplay interaction follows this pattern:

1. The game presents the current situation through the location description and available actions.
2. The player chooses an action by clicking a menu option or typing a command.
3. The game processes the action and updates the display, showing the results in the message log.
4. Time passes in the game world, potentially triggering events or status changes.
5. The cycle repeats, with the player making decisions based on the evolving situation.

Combat is handled through a turn-based system, where the player chooses actions (attack, defend, use item, etc.) and the results are described in text. The effectiveness of actions is determined by character skills, equipment, and random factors.

Exploration is managed through text descriptions and menu choices. For instance, when searching a location, the player might be presented with a list of areas to investigate (e.g., "Check the kitchen", "Look under the bed"), with each choice consuming time and potentially yielding discoveries or encounters.
